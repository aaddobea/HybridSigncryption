Subject: Verifpal Analysis of the Proposed Signcryption Protocol

---

### Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Verifpal analysis of the proposed signcryption protocol outlined in the associated paper. Verifpal, a powerful formal verification tool, was employed to assess the security properties of the protocol rigorously. The Verifpal software can be obtained from the official website: [Verifpal Website](https://verifpal.com).The suitable version can be downloaded and installed on your operating system.

### How to Use
