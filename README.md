Subject: Formal Verification of the Proposed Signcryption Protocol using Verifpal Symbolic software

---

### Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Verifpal analysis of the proposed signcryption protocol outlined in the associated paper. Verifpal, a powerful formal verification tool, was employed to assess the security properties of the protocol rigorously. The Verifpal software can be obtained from the official website: [Verifpal Website](https://verifpal.com).The suitable version can be downloaded and installed on your operating system.

### Abstract:  
The inception of blockchain technology has triggered the deployment of public key methods to safeguard on-chain data. While most existing methods may be unsuitable for blockchain implementation, they further increase the network scalability due to the schemeâ€™s complexity. Moreover, the storage of massive data on-chain also exacerbates the scalability issues. Therefore, in addressing such problems, this article proposes a lightweight hybrid signcryption scheme to secure patient medical data. To overcome storage limitations, the proposed method leverages decentralized offchain storage for managing vast medical data, thereby reducing the complexities associated with onchain execution. The off-chain mechanism generates a hash that links the off-chain data to on-chain storage. Subsequently, the patient encodes the encrypted data into a smart contract, which is verified by the doctor. A security analysis is performed with Verifpal to ensure the security strength of the proposed model. An in-depth experimental analysis is carried out to assess the computational and Communication outcomes and compare the suggested approach against other relevant methodologies. A decentralized off-chain experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of signcrypted data on decentralized off-chain storage.
